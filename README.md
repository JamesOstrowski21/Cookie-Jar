# Cookie-Jar

This program simulates a cookie jar. The user is prompted with a series of options at the start of the program.
The main one being to "deposit cookies" the user will then enter in the information of the cookies including, how
many, sugar content, type, and when they were made. Another option being "request cookie" the user is then prompted
for their name which stores how much sugar they are allowed to consume. The jar then gives the user a cookie of the 
appropiate sugar content or no cookie if the user has consumed too much sugar. The contents of the jar are then stored 
in a json file for the next time the user would like a cookie.
